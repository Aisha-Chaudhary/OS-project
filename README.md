Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and implement an efficient deadlock detection system using the Banker's Algorithm for multiple instances. The system aims to:
- Detect deadlocks in a multi-instance environment, where multiple processes compete for shared resources.
- Prevent deadlocks by dynamically allocating resources and managing process priorities.
- Ensure efficient resource utilization and minimize resource wastage.
- Handle multiple instances of resources and processes, making it scalable and versatile.
- Provide a robust and reliable solution for real-time systems, where deadlock detection and recovery are critical.
- Evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Banker's Algorithm in a multi-instance setting.
